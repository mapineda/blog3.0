This is my first post on my new blog/portfolio site. This time around I am using Gatsby and hosting on github pages.

Check out the repo [here](http://github.com/mapineda/blog3.0).

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

This site's mission is inspired from [MIT's mission statement](http://web.mit.edu/facts/mission.html).

*Meditations* is
>committed to generating, disseminating, and preserving knowledge, and to working with others to bring this knowledge to bear on the world’s great challenges
